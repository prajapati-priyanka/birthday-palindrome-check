# Birthday Palindrome Check
This is a app where you can check is your birthday a palindrome or not.

### How it works?
This app checks the input birthdate in six formats i.e. DD-MM-YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YY, MM-DD-YY, YY-MM-DD.
For example, if user entered date 12/01/1999, so app will check for 12011999, 01121999, 19990112, 120199, 011299, 990112.
If any of the combination is palindrome, app will show the given date is palindrome. 
If none of the formats is palindrome, app will give the closest date that is palindrome and also tells how many days it got missed.

### How to use?
1. Enter the birthdate.
1. Click the check button, to check wheather entered date palindrom or not.
